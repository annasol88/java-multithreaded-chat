Running the application:

IP and Port configurations can be found inside Utils.
    Currently set to run locally with the random port number of 9876.
    Please modify this if desired.

Running server:
    Run main in ServerDriver to run an instance of our ChatServer.
    This will run waiting for sockets to connect.

Running Client:
    Run main in ClientDriver to run an instance of a ChatClient.
    This will open a console UI which you can interact with.

Running multiple clients on the same machine:
    Edit configuration settings for ClientDriver to allow parallel run and
    run ClientDriver.main as many times as desired.

Running Synchronization Tests:
    Please run tests one at a time rather than the whole test suite for them to work.
